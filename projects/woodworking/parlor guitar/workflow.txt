Rim assembly
	Bend sides to match template
	Make neck and tail blocks
        Tail block: single piece of wood, 3" wide / 1" thick, grain parallel to sides, with 3 holes drilled downward (across grain) with dowels glued inside to prevent cracking
        Neck block: Laminated bass wood, 3" wide / 1" thick, 3 layers, outer layers parallel side grain, inner layer perpendicular, with holes drilled for neck, reinforced with CA glue around holes
	Glue neck and tail blocks to sides (http://www.kennethmichaelguitars.com/rim.html)
		Ensure the butt joint is square and centered
	Glue neck block (http://www.kennethmichaelguitars.com/rim2.html)
	Install kerfed lining
		Basswood, 5/8" tall, 1/4" thick
	Install side reinforcements
		Basswood, 1/8" thick 1/4" wide, vertical grain, spaced every 3 inches
		Lining will be cut to accept these reinforcements
	Radius top of rim using a 25' radius bar, and bottom of rim using 15' radius bar
Top assembly
	Join top
	Cut out top slightly larger than needed
	Install rosette
	Thickness top
	Cut soundhole
	Cut bracing, radius to 25'
	Glue bracing
	Trim bracing (tap tones)
	Trim lining to accept braces (http://www.kennethmichaelguitars.com/attachingtop.html)
	Glue top to body
	Sand (flapper discs?) top flush with sides
Back assembly
	Join back (https://www.jsbguitars.com/learn-guitar-making-techniques/plate-joining/)
	Install decorative stripe inlays if desired
	Thickness back
	Glue center brace (spruce)
	Cut ladder braces
	Radius ladder braces (15')
	Glue ladder braces on back
	Plane back side of rim down to approximate desired contour (3" to 3.75"?  Depends on wood width).  Measure and mark lines then plane to lines.
	Trim lining on body to accept braces (http://www.kennethmichaelguitars.com/attachback.html)
	Glue back to body
	Sand (flapper discs?) top flush with sides?  Router could work but is scary.
Install ede graft wedge
	Cut a slot (tapered)
	Glue end graft in place, optionally with purfling
Binding / Purfling on body
	Cut rabbets in body top / back with router
		Create a sort of sled for the body; some sort of shims to account for radiused top / bottom and keep everything flat.  Cork strips?
		If purfling is to be used, use 3/16" groove, followed by deeper 1/8" groove.
		If only binding is to be used, use 1/8" groove.
		To miter the purfling on the end wedge, don't cut all the way to the wedge, then clean up with a chisel.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6haG-aDM-eg at about 7:30 for instructions.
	Use a sizing mixture of 2:1 water:hide glue (or thin, super blonde shellac) to seal wood around channel and binding strips
	Dry fit, with mitered purfling, starting at tail, making sure that the binding is exactly square
	Use thin CA glue to glue binding in place
	Thoroughly sand to remove any surface glue
Rough neck assembly
	Laminate strips (Sapele outside, veneer of walnut, maple center?  Perhaps just leave out the walnut?  Perhaps replace walnut with rosewood if there is enough left over?)
	Cut to approx width (2"?)
	Glue heel using same laminations
	Cut scarf joint
	Add to sides of headstock
	Apply headstock veneer (Perhaps bookmatched rosewood outside and maple wedge to match end graft?  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n4VnkbsUaD0/SN1JeDszvjI/AAAAAAAAAS0/E_R8JxE_5yA/s320/234.jpg)
	Shape heel and drill to accept captive nuts

Attach neck (http://www.kennethmichaelguitars.com/neckfitpart1.html)
	Cut mortise in body ???
	Cut matching tenon on neck ???
