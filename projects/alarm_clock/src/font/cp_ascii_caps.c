/*
 * A simple ascii codepage, mapping all printable ascii characters. The index of this array is the value of 
 * each char in the string; the value of the array will point to an entry in the font table.
 * 0xFF has the special meaning of "Not implemented; leave blank".
 *
 * This codepage replaces lower case chars with upper case glyphs, to save the space
 * needed for the font glyphs.
 *
 * In general, this is mapped by 'ascii value - 0x20'.
